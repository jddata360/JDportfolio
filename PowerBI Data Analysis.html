								<h2>About Data</h2>
								
								 <p>My objective here is to utilize most PowerBI features which I had learned using different online course. I am curious in curating data and analysis. Such kind of mini projects (self made) is allowing to think and progress. As a part of my job I do regular data analysis and visualization techniques, However, I felt this isnt enough to showcase my talent.Hence I utilized open source platform to collect the raw data to analyse and build a dashboard. 
								   This dashboard consists of few aspects based on the questions.
												<ul>
												  <li> What is the data all about ? </li>
												  <li> How the data could be categorized ? </li>
												  <li> Within the categorization is there any dependency or relation 													between the data ? </li>
												  <li> What is the outcome ? </li>
												</ul>
								   </p>
								<h2>Results</h2>
								<p> Netflix Data Analysis : This dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of a Netflix dataset, 											     covering key metrics and trends related to shows and movies. The design is 											    clean, with a dark theme and prominent visuals that make the data easy to 											    interpret.</p>

										</p> <b> Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) - Top Row </b>
									
										<li> The top row of the dashboard presents high-level summary statistics, providing an 										     immediate overview of the entire dataset. </li>
										<li> Total Shows: 8800 - This represents the total number of unique shows and movies in 										     the dataset.</li>
										<li> Total Rating: 19 - This likely refers to the number of distinct or unique ratings 										    (e.g., TV-MA, PG-13, TV-G) present in the data.. </li>
										<li> Genre Shows: 515 - This could indicate the total number of unique genres available 										    across all shows and movies </li>
										<li> Total Directors: 4527 - The total number of unique directors represented in the 										     dataset.</li>
										<li> Start Year: 1925 - The earliest release year in the dataset. This is a very old 										     title, possibly a historical documentary or a classic film that has been added to 									  	     the platform. </li>
										<li> End Year: 2021 - The latest release year in the dataset, which aligns with the 										     typical end date for many Netflix datasets available publicly </li>

										</p> <b> Detailed Visualizations - Middle Row </b>
										<li> This row features three bar charts that break down the data by key categories. 											</li>

									<li> <b> Rating by total shows </b> : This horizontal bar chart shows the distribution of shows 										 based on their maturity rating. TV-MA has the highest number of shows, followed by 										 TV-14 and TV-PG. This indicates that a significant portion of the Netflix library is 										 geared toward mature audiences.The ratings PG-13, TV-Y7, TV-Y, and OK show 											 progressively fewer shows.</li>
				     					
									<li> <b> Genres by total shows </b>: This chart displays the top genres based on the number of 										 shows. Dramas, International Movies is the leading genre. This is followed by 											 Documentaries and Stand-Up Comedy, suggesting a strong presence of non-fiction and 										 comedic content on the platform.</li>

									<li> <b> Genres by Duration </b>: This bar chart likely shows the total duration (or number of 										 titles) for each rating category. It appears to be another view of the Rating by total 										 shows chart, showing the same order and distribution.</li> </p>

									</p> <b>Detailed Visualizations - Bottom Row </b>
										<li> This row provides different perspectives on the data, including geographical 										     distribution and a time-series analysis.</li> 

									<li> <b> Total Shows by Country </b>: This world map visualization highlights countries with 										 the most shows.
										 
										The darker red shading indicates a higher concentration of content. The map clearly 										shows that North America (especially the USA) and parts of Europe and Asia 											(particularly India) have the highest number of shows. This reflects the key markets 										where Netflix has a large content library.</li>

										<li> <b> Movies & TV Shows </b>: This donut chart provides a simple and effective 											 breakdown of the content type.</li>

										<li>    6.13K (69.62%) - The vast majority of the content is classified as 												Movies.</li> 
											
										<li>    2.68K (30.38%) - A smaller but still significant portion is classified as TV 											Shows. This shows that Netflix's library is predominantly film-based. </li>

										<li> <b> Total shows by release year:</b> This line chart visualizes the number of new 											 releases over time, broken down by Type (Movie vs. TV Show).

										<li>  The horizontal axis represents the Release Year, spanning from 1940 to 											 	2020 								
										<li>The chart shows a slow and steady increase in releases from the 1940s to the 											1990s.</li>

										<li> A massive surge in content, particularly for Movies, is visible from the early 										     2000s, with an explosive growth peak around 2018-2020.</li>

										<li>The peak year for releases seems to be 2018 with 767 shows, followed by 2019 an 										   2020. This trend highlights Netflix's aggressive content acquisition and production 										   strategy in recent years. </li>
